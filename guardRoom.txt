You enter into a fairly well lit room, furnished with a table and three chairs. On one wall is a cot for the off duty guards. A shield is displayed on the south wall. It has some sort of crest on it, but you can't make it out from here. A large iron bound chest rests on the ground at the foot of the cot.
